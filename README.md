# Change-Returned
My name is Kain Reinhardt and this is my program to get a dollar
amount of input from a user then calculate the least amount of
change to give them based on the input.

This program completes the task by receiving the input and then
separating the dollar amount from the cents amount. After that,
the dollar amount goes through a function that sees how many times
it can be divided by ten and then outputs the amount of times.
This does it for 5 and 1 as well. Then it does the same for the
cents by dividing by 25 for quarters, 10 for dimes,
and 1 for pennies.
